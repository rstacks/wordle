## Features

## Requirements

This project requires **JDK 17** or later, which you can find here:

[Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

Select the version that matches your OS and architecture. I recommend downloading the latest version of JDK. After downloading, follow the instructions
to install it.

## Download

Windows: [wordy-windows.zip](https://github.com/rstacks/wordy/raw/main/wordy-windows.zip)

Linux: [wordy-linux.tar.gz](https://github.com/rstacks/wordy/raw/main/wordy-linux.tar.gz)

## Instructions

- Extract the contents of the zip file or tarball to a known location. For Linux users, run this command from the directory that contains your download:

```
$ tar -xzf wordy-linux.tar.gz
```

- **Make sure that the** <code>wordy-1.0.jar</code> **file is in the same directory as all four text files.**
- On Windows, simply double-click on the jar file to start the game. Linux users should run the following command from the directory of the extracted files (this should also work for Windows users):
